Material for the Final Course Project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course, Johns Hopkins April 2015

# Tasks

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Files

In this repo you can find the following four files:
- README.md: gives general information about the Course Project and describes how the script works;
- run_analysis.R: contains the script necessary to run the steps as requested in the Tasks;
- averagesData.txt: the final tidy data set
- CodeBook.md: describes the variables in the final data set.
